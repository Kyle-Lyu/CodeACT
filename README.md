# üê± CodeACT: Code Adaptive Compute-efficient Tuning Framework for Code LLMs

## Overview

Motivated by the need for more effective and efficient training, we propose the **Code Adaptive Compute-efficient Tuning (CodeACT)** framework. CodeACT introduces the **Complexity and Diversity Aware Sampling (CDAS)** method to select high-quality training data based on complexity and diversity, and the **Dynamic Pack** padding strategy to reduce computational resource usage by minimizing padding tokens during training. 

Experimental results demonstrate that ***CodeACT-DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B***, fine-tuned on only 40% of the EVOL-Instruct data, achieves an 8.6\% performance increase on HumanEval, reduces training time by 78%, and decreases peak GPU memory usage by 27%. 

## Coming soon.

This repository is currently under development, and the source code will be made available soon. We appreciate your patience and interest in our work.
